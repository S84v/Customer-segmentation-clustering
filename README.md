## <u>**Customer segmentation via clustering**</u>
This is a project to demonstrate customer segmentation via clustering. <br>
We will be practicing the following concepts in this project:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis / EDA 🔍
2. Data Preprocessing + Feature Engineering🛠️
3. Dimensionality Reduction via PCA 📉
4. Clustering via KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN 📊
5. Final Interpretation of the results 📝

**Note**: There will be no model building as this is not a supervised learning problem. <br>This project aims to gain insights about the customers in the data at hand so stakeholders can take relevant targeted decisions based on the behaviour patterns of the customers.
